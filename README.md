# Wine-Quality-Prediction

Given are a few input variables - fixed acidity , volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol and an output variable - quality.
The quality score of the wine is given between 3 and 8.
In the code, if quality score is greater than or equal to 7 the quality of the wine is considered to be good quality and if the quality score is less than 7 it is considered to be bad quality.

The model is made by using Random Forest Algorithm.
